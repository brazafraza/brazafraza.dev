                    <br /> Following a mission, the USS Chekibundi locked itself down. Samson, one of its officers, locked himself in the escape pod. The crew are at risk of dying, some already have, and he'll leave at the first sign he has to.


                    <br>Speak to your friends, find the truth. <br>This game was created for the 1-Bit Game Jam! The theme was "You start with everything, and end with nothing!"
                    <br>
                    <br>


                    <h4> DEVELOPMENT: LEVEL </h4>
                    Approaching this project, I worked closely with the narrative designer asking heaps of questions regarding game and enviornmental context. After discussions and reading over the script three times, I created a list of restraints for designing this level.<br><br> They are as follows:
                    <br> - Must take place on spaceship
                    <br> - Must have several personal rooms for characters
                    <br> - Must show signs that there had been more people in the spaceship before the events of the game take place
                    <br> - Must have a central area connecting to all key areas.

                    <br><br>These are the first sketches created for the level design. I took heavy inspiration from spaceships and architecture in Star Wars, Cowboy Bebop and Rick and Morty. I really liked the tight mechanically feel, not being to over futuristic and having the retro sci-fi feel. Below are some images I used as inspiration and my early paper sketches.

                    <i>Draft Desgin #1</i>
                    <br><br> As this was a 1 week jam, I didn't have a lot of time for iteration so I stuck with the initial concept. This is the first rough draft created of the level design.
                    This design was slightly altered after some feedback and slight gameplay changes.

                    <h4> DEVELOPMENT: SOUND </h4>
                    I made all the audio files for this projects excluding the music, who was made by John Sharp.
                    <br><br>
                    Creating the audio was a mix of recording sounds myself and using the SoundSnap library, finding sounds and editing them using audacity. After doing some research into game with lower bitrate sounds, I found an audacity plugin called Ring Modulator. Using this plugin, I was able to lower the bitrate for the audio files which gave them the crunchy sound you can hear in game. <br> Here are some examples of the audio below!
